Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.6.0
============================================

This is a compatibility release for the Pathfinder 1 system version 9.4.

Namely, the macro that shows the defenses card in the chat and the two macros
that look up details about an actor's spell books have been fixed.

Version 9.4 of the Pathfinder 1 system module is now required.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.5.0
============================================

This is a compatibility release for Foundry VTT v10.

Namely, the two macros that switch token lights on and off have been fixed
for Foundry VTT v10. This also means that version 10 of Foundry VTT is now
required. If you can't upgrade, please stay at 0.4.0.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.4.0
============================================

This release adds two new macros: "Light On" and "Light Off".

"Light On" changes all selected tokens to emit a light as bright as a
torch (6m bright and 12m dim, or 20ft bright and 40ft dim, respectively),
and "Light Off" switches the light off again.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.3.3
============================================

This release fixes a typo in the roll knowledge macro that prevented
"Knowledge (Religion)" from showing up.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.3.2
============================================

This release replaces a call to the deprecated function rollAbility() with
a call to rollAbilityTest().


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.3.1
============================================

This release enables dialogs for knowledge and skill checks on single actors.
Additionally, the compendium definition now uses type instead of entity, since
entity has been deprecated in Foundry VTT version 9.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.3.0
============================================

This release fixes the macros for version 9 of Foundry VTT. Version 9 is also
now required. If you can't upgrade, please stay at 0.2.3.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.2.3
============================================

In this release, the macros that ask the user for a spellbook recognite when
the token's actor has only a single spellbook and use that instead of asking.
Also, all dialog boxes now include the actor name.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.2.2
============================================

This is a maintenance release that simply updates the compatible Foundry VTT
version to 0.8.9.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.2.1
============================================

This release adds the skill "Disable Device" to the skill check macros, as it
was missing previously.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.2.0
============================================

This release sets a hard dependency on the Pathfinder 1e Foundry VTT system
module. It also adds caster level check and concentration macros that query the
user for the spellbook to use.


Changes in DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros 0.1.0
============================================

This is the first official release of DrMcCoy's Pathfinder Macros.
